          Hi, I'm Nithin Raju, a Full Stack Developer who enjoys building
          production-grade web platforms that solve real problems at scale.
          Over the past years, I've worked across React, Next.js,
          TypeScript, and Node.js to ship everything from a custom
          video/media player and device-fleet management tools for a
          digital-signage platform, to a franchise-based service marketplace
          and a real-time dating app. I care about owning features
          end-to-end — from UI design through API integration, feature-flagged
          rollouts, and clean, scalable architecture. When I'm not building,
          I'm usually exploring new tools in the React ecosystem.
          Let's connect if you're working on something interesting!
